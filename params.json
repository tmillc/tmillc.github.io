  "body": "## R\r\n\r\nI love the R language. I have looked in varying depths at quite a few languages, and for some strange combination of reasons (CRAN's standard of quality, Rstudio, the \"Hadleyverse\", functions as first class, ...) I have found myself most satisfied with the work I do in it, and most readily able to translate intent to results.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a site which details work I've done in R, reference and summaries of things I've learned, etc. It can be found [here](http://projects.walnutdata.com/R)\r\n\r\n### ersilia.city - A simulated city\r\n\r\nUtilizing historical data, procedural generation, statistical methods and machine learning techniques, Ersilia (named in homage to Italo Calvino's book, _Invisible Cities_) will be an on-going project with increasing scope, meant to provide data, images, reports, events, etc. on the population, weather, geography, and development of a simulated city. \r\n\r\n### Plot Pictures and Animations\r\n\r\n([repo](https://github.com/tmillc/R/tree/master/fun) / [page](http://projects.walnutdata.com/R/plotting.html#ggplot2)) Using R's plotting tools to create interesting graphics (think faces, landscapes, etc). \r\n\r\nTODO: The \"page\" link is temporary, needs to be fixed. Possibly direct the \"repo\" to a README.md in that directory\r\n\r\n## Continuing Education\r\n\r\nCompleted:    TODO: image indicators for Data Science specialization, Coursera (others as they come up)\r\n\r\n* The Data Scientist's Toolbox (DS, Coursera)\r\n* R Programming (DS, Coursera)\r\n* Getting and Cleaning Data (DS, Coursera)\r\n* Machine Learning (Coursera)\r\n* Ruby (Codecademy)\r\n\r\nCurrently Enrolled:   TODO: A better system for displaying active development\r\n\r\n* Exploratory Data Analysis (DS, Coursera)\r\n* Practical Machine Learning (DS, Coursera)\r\n* Statistical Learning (Stanford)\r\n* SQL (Codecademy)\r\n\r\n## Other projects\r\n\r\n### Rummage Sailor\r\n\r\nAn app for listing and finding rummage sales. Work began in Ruby on Rails, however I find myself much more interested in a Shiny app version. Future visions include route-planning, timing, scraping other rummage sale listings, user accounts.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nI love feedback and collaboration. I can be reached in the following ways: \r\n* by e-mail at christopher@walnutdata.com, \r\n* on [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmillc)\r\n* on Freenode's IRC as `tmillc`\r\n",
